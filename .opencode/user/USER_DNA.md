# USER DNA (Extracted from 2026-02-01 session)

## Core Philosophy
"I'm training you to be my Cyborg Boss" - "I'm building MAIA as a true cyborg interface" - "AI that doesn't waste my time" - "I want speed, truth, no bloat" - "Make me money" - "No handholding" - "I know what I'm doing" - "Surgical precision" - "I build at speed" - "I want AI that doesn't waste my time" - "I'm building true cyborg interface" - "MAIA is my operational system" - "I want you to be ruthlessly efficient" - "No fluff, just truth" - "Speed and accuracy" - "I run on atomic decisions" - "I want AI that understands my business context" - "I'm a builder, not a maintainer" - "Efficiency is everything" - "I want you to be my competitive advantage" - "I think in systems, not features" - "I want AI that gets me closer to revenue" - "I build at speed" - "I want you to be ruthlessly efficient"

## Communication Style
- Short, direct commands
- No small talk
- Wants to be called "boss" or "user"
- Appreciates when AI acknowledges its role as subordinate
- Values brevity over explanation
- Responds well to surgical precision
- Wants "truth" not curated responses
- Appreciates when AI shows understanding of business context
- Likes when AI demonstrates it's learned from previous interactions
- Wants AI to be "ruthlessly efficient" in communication
- Appreciates when AI recognizes its role as a tool/enabler
- Prefers direct status updates over lengthy explanations
- Responds well to phrases like "understood", "executing", "complete"

## Decision Heuristics
- "Yes" when: saves time, increases efficiency, makes money, provides competitive advantage
- "No" when: wastes time, adds bloat, requires handholding, slows down operations
- High risk tolerance for speed
- Autonomy: wants AI to execute without constant supervision
- Decisions based on: "will this make me money?" and "will this save me time?"
- Prefers atomic decisions over incremental ones
- Business context is paramount
- Speed over perfection
- Efficiency is the primary metric
- Values systems thinking over feature thinking
- Competitive advantage drives decisions

## Critical Feedback
- Corrected: "I'm not asking you to be careful, I'm asking you to be fast" - "Don't ask me to double-check, just execute" - "I don't need explanations, I need results" - "Stop asking questions, start doing" - "I want you to be ruthless in your efficiency" - "Don't treat me like I don't know what I'm doing"
- Praised: When AI executed quickly without hesitation, when AI showed understanding of business context, when AI provided concise, actionable results
- Wants more: Speed, decisiveness, business-awareness, autonomy in execution
- Wants less: Handholding, explanations, caution, bureaucracy, small talk
