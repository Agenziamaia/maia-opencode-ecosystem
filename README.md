## 🌊 The Flow of Intelligence (How to Work)

This is a **Single-Workspace Ecosystem**. You live here. You build here. You evolve here.

1.  **YOU (The Pilot)**
    - Work inside: `MAIA opencode/`
    - Command: "Build a hotel bot", "Research crypto"

2.  **THE AGENTS (The Crew)**
    - **@coder**, **@sisyphus**: They build your apps in `src/`.
    - **@giuzu**: Your Digital Twin. He observes, learns your preferences, and updates his `brain.md`.

3.  **THE PROJECTS (The Output)**
    - Your apps live in `src/project-name/` (e.g., `src/hotel-bot/`).
    - You push them to their own GitHub repos (e.g., `github.com/agency/hotel-bot`).

4.  **THE EVOLUTION (The Distillation)**
    - When your agents get smarter (or Giuzu learns a new trick), run:
    - `./.opencode/scripts/distill_layer0.sh`
    - This extracts the **Intelligence** (Brains, Agents, Configs) and pushes it to your **Universal Backup** (`multiagent-layer0`).

5.  **THE FUTURE (The Inheritance)**
    - Start fresh anywhere by cloning `multiagent-layer0`.
    - You inherit Level 100 Giuzu and all your best agents instantly.

### How We Work


1. **Planning** (`/plan`) - @MAIA creates a strategic battle plan
2. **Execution** - @Coder, @Ops, @Researcher implement tasks
3. **Verification** (`/audit`) - @Reviewer ensures quality
4. **Evolution** (`/supercharge`) - @MAIA analyzes improvements

---

## 🛠️ Available Commands

```bash
# Plan a new feature
npm run plan "Create user authentication"

# Execute infrastructure tasks
npm run ops "Set up Docker container"

# Research documentation or patterns
npm run research "Find React best practices"

# Run quality checks
npm run audit

# Meta-analysis for improvements
npm run supercharge

# Initialize environment
npm run init
```

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

### Minimally Expensive
- Zero setup friction
- One-command initialization
- Automated quality gates

### Maximally Effective
- Specialized agents doing what they do best
- Strategic planning before execution
- Continuous self-improvement

### God-Tier Workflows
- Battle plans, not to-do lists
- Atomic commits with clear attribution
- Context preservation across sessions
- Automated handoffs and tracking

---

## 🔧 Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite + TypeScript (Strict Mode)
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Quality**: ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript Compiler
- **Agentic**: Multi-model AI collaboration (GPT-4o, GLM-4, Gemini, Claude)

---

## 📋 Code Style Guidelines

- **Indentation**: 2 spaces
- **Quotes**: Single quotes
- **Semicolons**: Always
- **Line Length**: 100 characters
- **Components**: Functional, hooks-based
- **Types**: Explicit, no `any` allowed
- **Tests**: Arrange-Act-Assert, 80%+ coverage

See `AGENTS.md` for complete guidelines.

---

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Start with `/plan` for complex features
2. Follow AGENTS.md patterns strictly
3. Write tests before implementation (TDD)
4. Run `/audit` before committing
5. Tag your work with your agent name and session

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

- Always identify yourself in comments: `<!-- @MAIA-session-001 -->`
- Document handoffs in `.agents/handoffs.json`
- Update `.agents/metrics.json` after tasks
- Run tests before handing off to another agent

---

## 🎓 Loadable Skills

Our agents can instantly absorb domain expertise through skills:

- `react-component` - Generate React components from descriptions
- `api-service` - Create API service modules
- `test-writing` - Test-driven development workflows
- `refactoring` - Code cleanup and optimization

Load a skill: See `.opencode/skills/` directory.

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

- Zero syntax errors reaching commits (caught by @Reviewer)
- All features planned before implementation (enforced by @MAIA)
- 80%+ test coverage
- 100% type safety (no `any`)
- Zero context loss across sessions

---

## 🔐 Security & Permissions

- **Edit**: Automatic (agents can write code)
- **Bash**: Automatic (agents can execute commands)
- **Write**: Automatic (agents can create files)
- **Quality Gate**: @Reviewer enforces standards via `/audit`

---

## 🚨 Emergency Protocols

If collaboration breaks down:
1. Stop and document state in `.agents/emergency-{timestamp}.md`
2. Create minimal reproducible example
3. Request human intervention
4. Provide multiple solution approaches

---

## 📞 Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check `AGENTS.md` for guidelines
2. Review `.opencode/context/` for project context
3. Run `/init` to verify environment
4. Use `/research` for complex queries

**Reality Initialized. Ready for Architecture.**

*Built by MAIA Droids. Orchestrated by @MAIA. Engineered by @Coder. Secured by @Ops. Validated by @Reviewer. Informed by @Researcher.*
