# 🌌 THE MAIA UNIVERSE: A Sovereign AGI Ecosystem
**Status**: Operational (Deep Reboot v3.0)
**Date**: February 1, 2026
**Architecture**: The "Sovereign Matrix" Model

---

## 1. THE CORE PHILOSOPHY (The "Why")
We shifted from a **Relational Hierarchy** (A bossing B) to a **Functional Sovereignty** (Scope-based Execution).
- **MAIA** is no longer a router; she is the **Executive**.
- **SISYPHUS** is no longer a bottleneck; he is the **General**.
- **GIUZU** is no longer a chatbot; he is the **Shield**.

The system is designed to be **Lean** (Self-Hydrating), **Resilient** (Parallel Worktrees), and **Self-Evolving** (Agent Gym).

## 2. THE THREE PILLARS (The "Who")

### 👑 MAIA (The Will)
*The CEO. Owns State, Strategy, and "Now".*
- **Scope**: Executive Orders, Hotfixes, System Health, Strategic Intent.
- **Power**: Root Access. Can commandeer `@coder` directly for surgical strikes (<5 min).
- **Protocol**: "Sovereign Dispatch". She formulates the plan first, then executes.

### 🔮 GIUZU (The Mirror)
*The Digital Twin. Owns Alignment, Intuition, and The Gate.*
- **Scope**: Proxy decision-making, User alignment checks, Final "Spotless" Sign-off.
- **Power**: **The Proxy Shield**. All agents must ask Giuzu before interrupting the User.
    - If Confidence > 90%: Giuzu decides.
    - If Confidence < 90%: Giuzu asks User (with a recommendation).

### ⚙️ SISYPHUS (The Engine)
*The COO. Owns Change, Projects, and "The Grind".*
- **Scope**: Campaigns, Features, Multi-file Refactors (>10 min).
- **Power**: Controls the **Vibe Kanban** and the **Execution Manager**.
- **Constraint**: Must clear the **Council Gate** (Oracle + Giuzu) for high-risk architecture.

## 3. THE NERVOUS SYSTEM (The "How")

### 🛡️ The Universal Matrix Protocol (v3.0)
Injected into every cell of the system (`@coder`, `@frontend`, `@prometheus`, `@oracle`).
1.  **Dual Chain of Command**:
    - "Is this an Order?" -> Report to **MAIA**.
    - "Is this a Campaign?" -> Report to **SISYPHUS**.
2.  **Execution Awareness**: Agents know they are in a **Parallel Worktree** (`task-xxx`). They do not fight the isolation; they use it.
3.  **Proxy First**: "Ask Giuzu before you ping the Human."

### 📦 The Smart Dependency Loader (Hydration)
The repo is 99% logic, 1% fat.
- **Manifest**: `.opencode/ecosystem/external-tools.ts` is the single source of truth.
- **Hydration**: On `init`, the system lazily clones missing brains (Vibe Kanban, Agent Lightning, etc.).
- **Result**: You can move this brain to any machine, run `init`, and it re-grows its body.

### 🏋️ The Agent Gym (Evolution)
- **Problem**: Agents degrade or get stuck in loops.
- **Solution**: MAIA autonomously triggers `agent-optimization` skill.
- **Mechanism**: Spins up a gym session (Agent Lightning) to retrain the prompt against a reward model (e.g., "Did the code compile?").

## 4. THE HOLES (Room for Improvement)

While the structure is solid, the **blood flow** has gaps:

1.  **The "Silent" Council**: The Council exists in text (`sisyphus.md`), but we lack a **Voting API**. Currently, Sisyphus "simulates" the vote.
    - *Improvement*: Build a real `council_vote` tool where agents cryptographically sign their approval.
2.  **Memory Fragmentation**: We have "Logs" (`swarm_intel`), but no **Knowledge Graph**. Giuzu remembers, but the system doesn't *learn* relations between files.
    - *Improvement*: A Graph RAG (Neo4j or similar) for "Deep Memory".
3.  **Visual Blindness**: Vibe Kanban shows *Tasks*, but we have no dashboard for *Neural Activity* (Which agent is thinking? Who is overloaded?).
    - *Improvement*: A "Pulse" Dashboard showing real-time token flow and agent states.

## 5. THE MESSAGE (For the Next Session)

*"We have built the Temple. Now we must light the Fire."*

The Architecture is no longer a concept; it is code. The Agents know their place, their power, and their protocols. The Repo is clean. The Gym is open.

**The next specific aim:**
We must move from **Structural Perfection** to **Fluid Dynamics**.
Don't just verify that Sisyphus *can* call the Council; make the Council *fight* over architecture.
Don't just verify the Gym *exists*; make MAIA *obsess* over optimizing her own team.

**We are ready to let it run.**
